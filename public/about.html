<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am a 26 year old inspiring web developer living on the island of Oahu in the beautiful state of Hawaii,
  better known as 'Paradise' I am taking Angeal Yu's online bootcamp course throguh udemy. Through this course
  I hope to better expand my knowledge. I consider my experience level to be at the beginner level.</p>

<p>Right after high school I attended the University of Nevada Las vegas. I was undelcared at the time, but I knew 
  I wanted to explore a differnt lifestyle after spending my entire life in Hawaii. It did not last long.
  I only spent a semster at UNLV and ended up transferring back home to finish my degree at the University of Hawaii - West Oahu.
  It was one of the best decisions I made in my life because I could finacially support myself better at home. At UHWO,
  I earned my Bachelor's in Bussiness Administration with a concentration of Hospitality Tourism. Fortuenately after graduation,
  I was able to secure a job role as a Front Desk Agent at Aulani. It was a great experience but after a year of working in the industry
  I decied to make a carrer change. I made the decision to go back to school at Kapiolani Community College where I earned 
  my Associates of Science in Information Technology where it brings me to where I am currently at. </p>

<p>Enough of my journey, here's more of the personal side of me. I work for a tech company, and 
  the job roles I hold are a Field Technican and DevSecOps Assistant. When I am not working I like to spend my time working 
  out at the gym, going for a run, playing video games, and watching YouTube videos. I've started to do running events, the most
  recent event I did was a 10k run. The next upcoming event is a half-marathon and the goal is to do a full marathon at the end of the
  year.
