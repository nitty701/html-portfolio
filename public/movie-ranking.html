<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>This is one of my all-time favorite horror movies.
   I have an engraved memeory of seeing this movie when it
   first came out. I saw it in a packed movie theatre. At that time,
   I had low expectations of horror movies because the selection
   that was coming up were horrible. There was a lot of hype to The
   Conjuring and it lived up to it.

<h3>Click</h3>
<p>
   One of the first comedy films that I fell in love with is Click
   with Adam Sandler. This film also inspired me to watch every 
   other Adam Sandler movie that he was in and all the future ones.
   I just remember watching this film over and over and over again,
   and not getting tired of it. Not only was it a genuis comedic film,
   but it also touched my heart.

<h3>Trap</h3>
<p>
   This movie came up on my Netflix reccomondations and it met my expectations for 
   a suspenful/thriller movie. It always kept me wondering "what is going to happen next". Plus,
   the storyline was great.
